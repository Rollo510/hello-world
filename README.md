# hello-world
Just trying out GitHub

I really have no idea what I'm doing with this programming stuff.  Seriously, if you have any ideas or help for me please, for the love of all that is good and holy in this terrible world, give it to me.  I need it so bad right now, I have zero faith or confidence in myself being able to succeed at this.
